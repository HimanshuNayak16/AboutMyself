#### I have made ShopLane Web application using HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript.

#### This application use api to fetch products in two categories namely Clothings and Accessories in home page. On clicking product card, you'll be redirected to that particular product page where you can add product to the cart on clicking 'Add to Cart' button. This application uses local storage of browser to implement add to cart functionality. On clicking cart icon in navigation menu, you'll we redirected to checkout page. On clicking 'Place Order' button, you'll be redirected to order confirmation page, where you will see message 'Order placed successfully!' and subsequently clears the products added to cart.
